## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

Foundations - Higher-level programming

## First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end 
Each task is linked and will help you to:

    put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances

    create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, 
Placeintegration

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General

    How to create a Python package
    How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
    What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
    How to serialize and deserialize a Class
    How to write and read a JSON file
    How to manage datetime
    What is an UUID
    What is *args and how to use it
    What is **kwargs and how to use it
    How to handle named arguments in a function

## Requirements

Python Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7 or more)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
    All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

## Python Unit Tests

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files should end with a new line
    All your test files should be inside a folder tests
    You have to use the unittest module
    All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
    All your test files and folders should start by test_
    Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
    e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
    e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
    All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
    You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
    All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you t miss any edge case

## More Info
Execution

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
